XSS

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection,
in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign
and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses
a web application to send malicious code, generally in the
form of a browser side script, to a different end user
Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite
widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input
from a user within the output it generates without
validating or encoding it. An attacker can use XSS to send
a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user's
browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted,
and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came
from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any
cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information
retained by the browser and used with that site.
These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.
